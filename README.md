## :taco::sandwich::green_salad:  Developing a recipe recommendation engine :spaghetti::curry::ramen:
On most days, my biggest problem at the end of my work day is deciding what to have for dinner. As a person who enjoys cooking and wants to cut down on takeout and delivery spending, I often have a hard time deciding what to cook, which is why I want to use my new data skills to develop a recommendation engine for cooking recipes.

### What is your main goal?
My goal is to generate a recommendation engine that can be used to provide recommendations of recipes in different scenarios.

### What data sources did you use?
I used a dataset from Kaggle, which is a collection of recipes from Food.com and the user interactions with the recipes.

### What techniques and tools did I apply?
Machine learning and Recommendation Engines:
* Non-personalized recommendations
* Content-Based recommendations
* Collaborative Filtering (item-based and user-based)
